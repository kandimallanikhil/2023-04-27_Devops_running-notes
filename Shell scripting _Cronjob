To achieve this, you can create a shell script that:

Captures CPU and memory utilization.
Saves the results to a file.
Uploads the file to an S3 bucket.
Deletes files older than 7 days from the S3 bucket.
Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Install AWS CLI (if not already installed)
Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install awscli -y

# Configure AWS CLI with your credentials
aws configure
Step 2: Write the Shell Script
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name"
DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
FILE_NAME="cpu_mem_util_$DATE.txt"
FILE_PATH="/tmp/$FILE_NAME"

# Capture CPU and memory utilization
echo "CPU and Memory Utilization on $DATE" > $FILE_PATH
echo "==================================" >> $FILE_PATH
echo "" >> $FILE_PATH
echo "CPU Usage:" >> $FILE_PATH
top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)" >> $FILE_PATH
echo "" >> $FILE_PATH
echo "Memory Usage:" >> $FILE_PATH
free -m >> $FILE_PATH

# Upload the file to S3
aws s3 cp $FILE_PATH s3://$BUCKET_NAME/

# Clean up local file
rm -f $FILE_PATH

# Delete files older than 7 days from S3
aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET_NAME/ | while read -r line; do
    createDate=$(echo $line | awk {'print $1" "$2'})
    fileName=$(echo $line | awk {'print $4'})
    olderThan=$(date -d "$createDate +7 days" +%s)
    now=$(date +%s)
    if [ $now -gt $olderThan ]; then
        if [ "$fileName" != "" ]; then
            aws s3 rm s3://$BUCKET_NAME/$fileName
        fi
    fi
done
Step 3: Schedule the Script to Run Daily at 9:00 AM
To schedule this script to run every day at 9:00 AM, you can use a cron job.

Edit the crontab file:

bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add the following line to schedule the script:

bash
Copy code
0 9 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
This will run the script every day at 9:00 AM.

Step 4: Permissions and Execution
Ensure the script is executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh
Notes:
Replace your-s3-bucket-name with the actual name of your S3 bucket.
Ensure the AWS CLI has the appropriate permissions to read and write to the S3 buck
